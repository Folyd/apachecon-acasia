The presentation will focus on leveraging the in-memory columnar storage format Apache Arrow, an out-of-the-box query engine Apache Datafusion implemented in Rust, and a universal storage data access layer Apache OpenDAL. By integrating these powerful ASF open-source projects, we built a cloud-native, high-performance, flexible time series database that provides efficient storage and querying support for time series data.
