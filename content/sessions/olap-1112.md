Elasticsearch has been widely used in ad scenarios. However, in many scenarios, their query patterns are flexible and complex, and their performance requirements cannot be met by ES. To more effectively support complex analytical processing (AP) queries in these scenarios, we have implemented SQL parsing and execution plan construction on the Elasticsearch cluster using the Calcite framework. It supports most common SQL operations and enables efficient Joins.
In this presentation, we will delve into how Elasticsearch utilizes Calcite to optimize execution plans. Our discussion will cover several key topics: defining and managing metadata based on external tables, query partition pruning,  pushdown of filter conditions, Elasticsearch Routing mechanisms and custom data distribution strategies, the optimization of RuntimeFilter, etc.
