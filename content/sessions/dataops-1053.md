This speech introduces Xiaomi’s construction of a visual full-link data monitoring system in data integration practice.

The focus of this sharing is on the implementation of data integration full-link data monitoring technology in Xiaomi. Starting from the data integration link system, in view of the reliability challenges encountered in data integration practice, from the perspective of the visual full-link data monitoring construction plan Share and explain aspects such as proposal and implementation. Focusing on the two themes of data integration reliability and full-link monitoring, the speech explained the benefits of building an observable data integration full-link monitoring system in improving data integration reliability and user experience.

Section 1. The development of data integration in Xiaomi
In Xiaomi's daily operations, data integration plays a vital role. It is a bridge that connects various business modules and realizes data sharing and circulation. Through data integration, we can efficiently integrate data from different sources and formats to provide strong support for subsequent data analysis and business decisions. This chapter will introduce the development history of data integration in Xiaomi, supported data links, business scope, and job orders of magnitude

Section 2: Reliability Challenges Faced by Data Integration
For the average user, data integration is often a black box process. They don't understand how data is transferred from one system to another or the problems that may be encountered during the transfer. This opacity increases user concerns about data reliability. This chapter will introduce the users’ doubts about the reliability of data integration and the challenges of data consistency that Xiaomi encountered during data integration.

Section 3: Construction and practice of full-link data monitoring
This chapter starts from the reliability of the synchronization link and introduces the construction of the full-link data monitoring system, including large-scale data statistics, real-time traffic monitoring of operations, full-link data count statistics based on rolling windows, and end-to-end data comparison. Through these capacity building efforts, Xiaomi’s work on data integration reliability is demonstrated.

Section 4: Future Prospects and Directions for Improvement
In the future, the scope of real-time monitoring links will be expanded, traffic control capabilities will be improved to improve link stability, and data verification in offline scenarios will be supported.

In the field of data integration, it has reference significance for building an observable monitoring link system, enhancing the stability of data integration, and improving user experience.
