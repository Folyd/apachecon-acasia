Apache YuniKorn is a lightweight, universal resource scheduler for running batch workloads in Kubernetes. YuniKorn extends the scheduling capabilities of Kubernetes and supports a wide variety of workloads such as batch processing, data analytics, and machine learning tasks, with robust support for frameworks such as Spark, Flink, and TensorFlow.

YuniKorn 1.0.0 was released in 2022 and contained many major features, e.g. App-aware scheduling, Hierarchy Resource Queues, Gang Scheduling. Since then, the project has continued to grow, and until the latest release, 1.5.0 (released on March 14, 2024), many new features have been included, such as Preemption, User Quota Enforcement, and an Event System.

In this talk, we will provide a basic introduction to the project and focus on the changes and improvements that have occurred in recent releases. Besides this, we also want to look into the future and highlight some topics the community is currently working on and give an insight into the roadmap for planned features.
