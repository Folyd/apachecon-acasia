In today’s distributed system architectures, including Apache Cassandra distributed database, troubleshooting is a major challenge. Despite many observability frameworks, compatibility and configuration issues persist. OpenTelemetry has changed the game by standardizing observability data collection. This talk will demonstrate integrating the Apache Cassandra Java Driver with OpenTelemetry for end-to-end tracing, showing how to collect and visualize tracing events for analysis. This significantly speeds up diagnosing issues and resolving performance bottlenecks. We'll also share real-world examples to highlight the importance of end-to-end tracing in enhancing system robustness and observability.
