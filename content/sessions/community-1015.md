The popularity of open source has been on the rise in recent years. Many companies are actively participating in upstream open source projects and making contributions. They are also taking the initiative to open source their mature solutions. 

However, launching an open source project from scratch can be challenging for most small and medium teams. In the past year, I had the opportunity to do this work in one startup, including project initiation, decision-making, planning, building, organizing, and final public.

Honestly, it was both tough and exciting work. We adopted many Apache ways for our open source project, including how to incubate our project, and how to measure it through the Apache Project Maturity Model, etc. I think I can share my story on the whole process, which can be for a reference in the same situation with me.
