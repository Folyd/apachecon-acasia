In the rapidly evolving landscape of stream processing, Apache Flink has emerged as a powerful platform for developing robust, scalable, and real-time data processing applications. However, managing configurations for Flink applications in a dynamic environment poses significant challenges, including the need for flexibility, consistency, and the ability to adapt to changes without downtime. This technical session introduces a comprehensive approach adopted in eBay's Notification Platform team to dynamic and incremental configuration management that simplifies the process of updating Flink application settings on-the-fly.

Our proposed solution leverages a centralized configuration service that interfaces with Flink's runtime to  provide a unified and configuration management system. We will delve into the architecture of this system, which includes features such as real-time updates, versioning, rollback capabilities, and environment-specific configuration profiles.
