The AMQP protocol is a standard application layer protocol in the field of message middleware. With its long history, active community, rich ecology, full coverage of multi-language SDK and other advantages, it has become one of the most widely used standard message protocols, even today, Kafka, RocketMQ, etc. Nowadays, distributed message queue products are popular, but they still occupy a place in the messaging field and are widely adopted by users.

However, due to historical reasons, the current open source implementation of RabbitMQ has architectural limitations, resulting in certain deficiencies in performance, scalability, maintainability, scalability, etc. As a proven distributed messaging middleware, Apache RocketMQ Based on Apache RocketMQ, we are compatible with the AMQP 0.9.1 protocol, providing a more reliable, easy-to-operate, and high-performance message middleware solution for users who already use the AMQP protocol and upgrades of old systems.

This speech mainly talks about the technical architecture and key technologies of implementing compatible AMQP protocol based on Apache RocketMQ, including the following parts:
1. Architecture of AMQP open source product RabbitMQ
2. AMQP on RocketMQ overall architecture design
3. Key technical points of AMQP on RocketMQ
4. Comparison of AMQP on RocketMQ functions and performance
5. Open source of AMQP on RocketMQ
