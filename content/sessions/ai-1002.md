In the current tech development trends, large models in AI have become a crucial force driving innovation. However, this leads to an increasing demand for observability and monitoring of these models. Within the Apache ecosystem, OpenTelemetry, as an emerging open-source project, provides standardized tools and interfaces for cross-language telemetry data collection and analysis, while the development of automatic probe injection technology further simplifies the integration process of monitoring systems. This topic will delve into how Apache projects and OpenTelemetry can be leveraged, in conjunction with automatic probe injection technology, to build an efficient, flexible, and scalable observability system for AI large models.

The content of the topic will include:
- Apache and AI Observability: Discussing the contributions of Apache projects to building an observability architecture for AI large models and how the Apache ecosystem promotes innovation and development in this area.
- The Value and Application of OpenTelemetry: Providing a detailed introduction to the role of OpenTelemetry in the observability of AI large models, including how it can be used to collect, process, and analyze telemetry data.
- The Revolution of Automatic Probe Injection: Analyzing how automatic probe injection technology addresses the challenges of integrating telemetry systems in large-scale, distributed AI systems, making it more convenient for developers and operations teams to deploy and manage monitoring tools.
- Integrated Strategies and Best Practices: Sharing success stories showcasing how Apache projects, OpenTelemetry, and automatic probe injection can be combined to enhance the observability of large models, facilitate system performance optimization, and fault diagnosis.
- Facing Future Challenges and Opportunities: Discussing the upcoming challenges in the field of AI observability and how the Apache ecosystem and the open-source community can collaboratively drive technological progress and innovation in this area.

This topic aims to show participants how to utilize resources and projects within the Apache ecosystem to achieve efficient observability of AI large models, further supporting the stability and reliability of AI applications, and providing practical insights and strategies for the open-source community and enterprises.
