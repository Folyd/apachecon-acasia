Apache Iceberg as an open data lake table format, providing a highly open and efficient unified storage solution. In production, it's essential to manage and optimize its files and metadata to achieve better performance and reduced overhead. Amoro, as a data lake management system, can compact Iceberg's small files and delete files in real-time, enhance actual query performance. Additionally, it assists Iceberg in automatically performing maintenance processes such as expiring snapshots, cleaning orphaned data, and removing expired data, significantly reducing manual maintenance efforts.
