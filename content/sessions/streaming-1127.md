With the internal demand for streaming tasks at Bytedance escalating on a daily basis, the large-scale implementation of Flink SQL has become increasingly prevalent across multiple departments. Flink SQL, being a cost-effective entry-point, has seen the scale of streaming SQL tasks elevate to over 30K, while task resource utilization has reached several million cores. Amidst the corporate emphasis on cost reduction and efficiency augmentation, we have undertaken a multitude of performance enhancements in the areas of Query Optimization and Query Execution. These widespread implementations within Bytedance have contributed to a reduction of approximately 17% in CPU usage.
        In this presentation, we will provide a detailed overview of the main optimizations carried out within ByteDance and the achieved results.
