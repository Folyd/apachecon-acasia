Apache Kafka Community Edition is an excellent distributed event streaming platform, but due to its integrated design of computing and storage, its elasticity is poor and the cost of operating large-scale clusters is high. Alibaba Cloud Kafka has been fully upgraded based on the open-source Kafka, combining cloud-native infrastructure such as elastic computing, high-performance distributed file storage, and container services to achieve the cloud-nativeization of Kafka. It has low latency, high throughput, extreme elasticity, and easier operation and maintenance. The cloud-native Kafka architecture can efficiently cope with the operation and maintenance of extremely large-scale Kafka clusters, and is the technical foundation for realizing Kafka Serverless cloud services.
