Why contribute to open source? My perspective on open source is that it is truly remarkable to browse the homepages and project lists of major companies and foundations on GitHub. It's inspiring to see how they selflessly share their labor and contribute their achievements to the entire human society, fostering industry and social development.

Why become an Apache Committer? Becoming an Apache Committer offers numerous benefits, including personal professional growth, networking with talented peers, endorsement of individual capabilities through Apache email and a Committer certificate, enhanced competitiveness in the job market, active and extensive involvement in project development, improved professional image in the industry, free use of JetBrains tools, industry recognition acknowledged both domestically and internationally without any geographical boundaries.

Where to start? Start by engaging in community interactions with politeness and friendliness. Contribute by submitting relevant articles/videos, submitting pull requests (PRs), participating in community discussions, resolving other users' issues, providing suggestions for community/project improvements, enhancing documentation, conducting code reviews, checking DSIP for targeted submissions, and delivering project-themed presentations at public meetups. In summary, contribute to the community in any way possible. It is important to note that all contributions should adhere to the Apache Style, and communication through platforms like GitHub, Slack, and email is encouraged (WeChat doesn't count).

Community is greater than code. The cycle of community->code->project->users->community forms a positive feedback loop.

Standpoint: Align with the interests of the project/community.

To become an Apache Committer, treat yourself as one. Make long-term and sustainable contributions to the project/community using your professional expertise.

Be proactive and exhibit proactive initiative.

Each role has a clear and specific evaluation process on the Apache official website. The community's operational structure ensures maximum fairness and justice, and incidents of contribution theft are rare. So, feel confident and go ahead with your contributions; they will be seen and appreciated.

Never before has there been an organization that aligns so well with the ideals of an idealist like me.

Promotion path: user->contributor->committer->PMC->ASF Member.

Terminology explanation: A committer is an officially recognized role by the Apache organization.

The sense of accomplishment is a concentrated reflection of personal value.

There are very few people who engage in open source. Among all programmers in various industries, as of March 25, 2024, there are only 8,400+. If you contribute slightly more, your contributions are easily noticed.

All large commercial entities, and even government departments, rely on open source. They are invisible contributors that enable the smooth operation of society as a whole.

Liu Cixin's novel "April 1st, 2018" mentions the "IT Republic": "The IT Republic is a superpower in the virtual international community, with a population of eighty million and still growing rapidly. It is a country mainly composed of IT engineers, with strong political demands and a powerful influence on the physical international community."

"Programmers, network engineers, and database administrators constitute the main body of the IT Republic. This class is a reproduction of the industrial army of the 19th century in the 21st century, but with the labor part transitioning from physical to intellectual, and the burden has increased rather than decreased. In the sea of program code and the labyrinth of network hardware and software, they carry heavy loads like dockworkers from more than two hundred years ago and work overnight like prostitutes. The development of information technology progresses rapidly, and except for the lucky ones who climb to management positions, the knowledge and skills of others quickly become outdated. New IT graduates flock like hungry termites, pushing the old folks (who are not actually old, mostly in their thirties) aside, replacing and abandoning them. But the newcomers have no reason to be complacent. This is also the not-so-distant future for most of them... This class is called the technical proletariat.

Don't say we have nothing; we will format the world! These are the altered lyrics of the International anthem."

To become someone who changes the world, you must first have the idea of changing the world.

Wishing ambitious individuals to become committers soon.
