- Unified SQL Gateway for Big Data Security, SQL Traffic Management, and Usability
  - Masking the differences in access methods of various underlying engines, a consistent SQL service entry point is provided to users. It is compatible with Hive JDBC and supports HTTP access, offering convenience for integration with BI tools and SQL IDEs such as Apache Superset, Cloudera Hue, DataGrip, DBeaver, PowerBI, and Tableau. At the lower layer, it interfaces with mainstream computing and analytical engines like Spark, Trino, JDBC (Mysql/Postgres/Impala/Doris), and Flink. By integrating with internal unified permission and Catalog services, Xiaomi has enhanced the Kyuubi Proxy layer with unified SQL permission verification and data interception capabilities, addressing data privacy and security concerns and reducing the costs associated with individual implementations at the engine layer.
- Leveraging Automatic Routing Mechanism to Improve SQL Distribution Efficiency and Resource Utilization
  - SQL statements are analyzed for syntax and semantics in advance, and combined with the characteristics of the underlying engines, an automatic routing capability is realized, directing SQL to the most suitable execution engine. For engines of the same type, SQL distribution is managed based on the workload of the engine clusters, achieving rational utilization and efficient scheduling of resources.
- Detailed SQL Metrics at the Task Level for Comprehensive Understanding of User SQL Execution Details, Empowering Governance, Optimization, and Diagnosis
  - From the Kyuubi Proxy layer to the underlying engine, end-to-end SQL execution detail metrics are collected, forming a unified SQL feature library. This includes lineage information, SQL APP/Stage/Task-level metrics across various dimensions, and DAG information of the execution process. Based on this information, health diagnostics are implemented before, during, and after SQL execution, and have assisted in the governance and optimization of Iceberg, providing richer metrics for the internal metadata warehouse construction.
- Exploring Kyuubi's Notebook Capabilities
  - With the rapid development of AI, especially in algorithmic scenarios, the Notebook is a more popular development paradigm. However, during the development process, data processing and analysis are indispensable, and SQL alone cannot meet the complex processing scenarios of algorithms. Kyuubi supports not only SQL but also Scala/Python Code mode, opening up greater possibilities. We have attempted to integrate Kyuubi with Jupyter Notebook, providing users with a code-centric approach to solving both data processing and algorithmic challenges within the same architecture. Compared to the Spark code submission mode, Notebook significantly enhances development efficiency, avoiding lengthy debugging, packaging, and deployment processes.
