Iceberg tables have emerged as a powerful solution for managing large-scale data lakes, offering features like ACID compliant transactions, efficient data organization, and schema evolution. However, as data lakes grow in complexity, so do the challenges in managing the lifecycle of Iceberg tables effectively.
This session will delve into strategies for simplifying the management of Iceberg tables throughout their lifecycle. We will explore techniques for optimizing table creation, time travel, compaction, schema evolution, data retention, and archival processes. Additionally, we will discuss best practices for monitoring and maintaining the health and performance of Iceberg tables.
