Ant Group (fintech company with 25K employees) has been an active participant in Open Source community with many projects, yet most projects were primarily governed and operated by Ant Group and we don't actively work with OSS Foundations, Apache Foundation included for a long time.

Founding Open Source Program Office (OSPO) and begin properly doing OSS governance has changed that. Now, Ant Group has tailored OSS technical strategy, and comprehensive internal governance process + practices + products to support the strategy. Ant Group knows the importance of building internal Open Source culture and working with the community, but it takes time for the change to happen. How can we accelerate the change?

The Ant Group Open Source Incubation, deeply rooted in the principles of the Apache Way, is a dedicated platform fostering innovation and collaboration within the open-source ecosystem. It embraces the core tenets of community-driven development, meritocracy, transparency, and open communication, ensuring that projects nurtured under its umbrella adhere to the highest standards of quality, inclusivity, and sustainability.

This incubation provides a nurturing environment where nascent ideas can evolve into robust, production-ready software solutions. It offers comprehensive support services, including mentorship from experienced open-source contributors, access to cutting-edge tools and infrastructure, legal guidance on licensing and IP issues, and strategic assistance with project governance and community building.

Being attracted by the concepts of open source, collaboration and sharing, I joined Ant Open Source OSPO early last year. Before this, I was mainly engaged in strategic planning, hoping to bring a different perspective to open source education.
