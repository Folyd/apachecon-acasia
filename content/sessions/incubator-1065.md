Apache Paimon is a unified datalake format for both batch and streaming processing. Paimon innovatively combines the LSM tree structure in its lake format, enabling the realtime lakehouse architecture within Flink, Spark, Starrocks and more. We will begin with an overview of Apache Paimon, and how Paimon helps our users to build a data infrastructure with both low-latency and high throughput.

Starting as a sub-project from the Apache Flink community, Paimon once had a chance to directly become an Apache top-level project. We will next talk about why we still choose to go through the incubation process, how we gradually build our way to the top-level project, what we gain from and give back to the community, and how we build an active and diverse community under the Apache way.

Finally to conclude the session, we'll talk about the roadmap and the future of Apache Paimon after graduation, both from the product and from the community perspective.
