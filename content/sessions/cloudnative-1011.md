Apache APISIX is a dynamic, real-time, high-performance API gateway. It provides rich traffic management features like dynamic upstream, traffic limit, observability, etc. Also it supports multi protocols like http, grpc, dubbo, mqtt, etc.
This presentation introduces the practice of a cloud-native gateway based on Apisix for China Mobile Cloud, including an analysis of the cloud-native gateway architecture, the development of  ingress-controller, and how it helps China Mobile NetDisk in handling billions of daily access traffic.
