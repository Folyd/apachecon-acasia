Apache Celeborn, as an intermediate data service designed to boost performance, stability, and flexibility for Big Data compute engines, has made new progress in various areas including performance optimization, in-memory storage, security features, and improved stability. 
Concurrently, At Apache Community Over Code Asia 2023, Flink introduced a new hybrid shuffle architecture designed for dynamic adaptation between streaming and batch shuffle modes. 
The collaboration between Flink and Celeborn has further matured hybrid shuffle architecture and supports flexible switching between local and remote shuffles, allowing for simultaneously leveraging the benefits of both shuffle modes.
In this session, we will share this advanced shuffle framework, highlighting:
● The latest features and future roadmap in Apache Celeborn in different engines.
● The integration efforts and future plans for Flink's hybrid shuffle with Celeborn.
