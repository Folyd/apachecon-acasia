This talk focuses on democratizing AI, with open source Large Language Models (LLMs) and WebAssembly (Wasm), making AI accessible and efficient. 

Inference is estimated to consume over 90% of computing resources for AI workloads. Wasm does not only reduce AI inference cost, but also boosts deployment and accessibility of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling writing LLM apps on your PC and run everywhere â€“ from the edge to cloud, high-end servers to low-power IoT devices, across CPUs and GPUs. We will have interactive demos of deploying open source LLMs in various environments and creating serverless LLM app using Wasm with simple steps.

We'll also cover how Wasm and Wasm runtime provide high performance and security, to make AI models and apps portable, accessible, reliable and safe.

Attendees will learn how to run open source LLMs on their own devices, and integrate these techs in their own AI projects.
