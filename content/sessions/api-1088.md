Apache Dubbo is a high-performance RPC framework dedicated to providing excellent service governance capabilities. With the introduction of HTTP/3, its features based on the QUIC protocol offer new possibilities for Dubbo microservices communication. HTTP/3, by reducing latency, increasing transmission speed, enhancing security, improving packet loss resistance, and supporting 0-RTT connections, provides significant performance and reliability improvements for Dubbo in cloud-native environments for microservices communication.
