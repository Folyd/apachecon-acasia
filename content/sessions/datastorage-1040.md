Apache Cassandra is an exceptionally scalable, distributed NoSQL database engineered to manage vast quantities of data across numerous commodity servers, ensuring high availability without a single point of failure. In this session, we introduce a new project, EloqKV, which is built upon the robust foundation of Apache Cassandra. EloqKV enhances its capabilities by providing sub-millisecond read/write performance and full transaction support, functioning effectively as a consistent cache layer for Cassandra. Users can access the Data Substrate using the familiar Redis API, enjoying the speed of an in-memory database while leveraging Cassandra's capacity to store large datasets comprehensively.
