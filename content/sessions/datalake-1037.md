At present, there are no available free bigdata component management platforms for streamlined data management and analytics. This is because the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) is no longer free.

With a growing interest in similar platforms, Apache Bigtop and its incubator project, Bigtop-Manager, step in as free open-source alternatives to CDP. These alternatives are designed to provide a simpler and quicker approach to data management and analytics.

Furthermore, openEuler has over 300 organization members and has seen significant enterprise deployments, especially in China. An increasing number of users in China are showing interest in both Bigtop and openEuler.

In this talk, we will give an overview of the upcoming Bigtop 3.3 release and its support status of openEuler. We'll also unveil the new toolkit, Bigtop-Manager.  A simple demo will demonstrate the deployment and management solution for the bigdata components.
