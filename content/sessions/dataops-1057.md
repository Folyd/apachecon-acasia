Nowadays, more and more data are stored in different clouds and systems in different forms, which brings challenges to the enterprise's data governance, security control, and data compliance. The explosion of AI demand has also put forward more requirements for data governance. The unified metadata management platform Gravitino (planned to be donated to Apache incubator) can help enterprises clearly control their Data + AI assets, achieve multi-cloud and multi-engine support, unified management of data permissions, sensitive data identification, desensitization rule setting, etc.; This topic will focus on data compliance and data governance with metadata as the core combined with specific cases.
