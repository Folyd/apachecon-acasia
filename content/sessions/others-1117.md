In the past decade, there has been a significant shift in user demands for modern applications. Users expect applications to handle and respond to their needs in real-time, and to be consistently available. Additionally, applications face unprecedented volumes of data being transmitted from client to server, including real-time data, cloud computing events, messages from distributed business systems, and massive data from big data sources. Users also expect new applications to be rapidly developed and deployed with features and updates, incorporating agile methodologies and DevOps practices. This makes developers to evolve and iterate with suitable architectures to achieve rapid development and deployment of the final application.

With the current wave of Kubernetes container development, the challenge lies in effectively implementing enterprise microservices applications. This involves guiding enterprises and their end users towards transitioning traditional application practices to event-driven microservices applications. We will illustrate our best practice with real env user use cases based our world class product exprience of this domain. Including how to design from the beginning, mostly ultilize the kuberntes platform capability, combine with the latest upstream project Camel-K as an integration framework, integrating existing data and systems, incorporating cloud-native serverless architectures, Kafka, and message middleware platforms, as well as employing Capturing Data Change technology to realize a stream-based data-driven architecture and applications. This approach aims to address client pain points and ultimately achieve business stability and agility.
