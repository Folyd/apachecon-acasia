This content will introduce the network communication architecture of the Seata client, and how to perfectly combine it with the server in different store modes and register types, so that both the client and the server can achieve an ideal high-availability form, and in the future deployment form What changes are likely to occur? How will future architecture evolution make Seata more mature and the ecological architecture more closed-loop, save users' operation and maintenance deployment costs, lower the threshold for entry-level learning, be close to users' traditional usage habits, and be as mature as other top-level middleware.
