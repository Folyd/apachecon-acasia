        Project Ray, an open source distributed artificial intelligence framework that have a rapid development in the AI world, is now 
about to enter the 3.x development stage. Ray is originally born for high-performance reinforcement learning, while has evolved 
into a unified computing framework for scaling AI and Python workloads. Ray is also what behind the training of large language 
models such like ChatGPT.
       Whether the architecture and implementation of Ray can be further improved/extended to adapt to different hardware and 
software ecosystems is the main direction of our further research work at present, including various possible reconstructions of Ray. This topic targets at our latest exploration of the Java-based redesign and implementation of Ray:
       1）The pros and cons of current design and implementation 
             of Ray Core；
       2）The overall idea and architectural design of Graalvm- 
             centric RayII.Java(use Python+Java to replace the current  
             Python+C++ software layer in the current Ray project and 
             more) and our testbeds;
       3)  Try to integrate RayII.Java with well-known Java 
             frameworks in the AI field like DJL and H2O；
       4)  Explore to support accelerating Ray applications with 
            RayII.Java on more heterogeneous hardware 
            platforms(such as FPGA and NPU etc, Ray only supports 
            GPU by now) .
