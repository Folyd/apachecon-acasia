I'm a Java developer and rust fan, who graduated from Jiangxi Normal University. In February 2021, I collaborated with @hengyunabc to create vmtool in arthas. In April 2022, I became the ShenYu committer and created MemorySafeLinkedBlockingQueue. One month later, I joined the ShenYu PMC team and started to build an stackfull coroutine crate named open-coroutine. In April 2023, the preemptive scheduling feature is implemented for open-coroutine by me. In January 2024, I supported the WASM plugin in Apache ShenYu and quickly spread this idea to other communities, like dubbo and pulsar.
