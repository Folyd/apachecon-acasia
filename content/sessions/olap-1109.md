The session explores the integration of Apache Celeborn (Incubating) and Apache Gluten(incubating), a new incubating Apache project for native SQL engine support, to enhance Apache Spark's performance in big data computing environments. Gluten addresses CPU computation bottlenecks by utilizing native engines like Velox and ClickHouse and introduces a Columnar Shuffle mechanism. The integration of Celeborn, a Remote Shuffle Service, into Gluten enhances Spark's performance, stability, and elasticity. Performance tests show improved results in different environments. Overall, Gluten aims to provide a seamless experience for Spark users to leverage native engine advantages without migration challenges, while Celeborn enhances Shuffle operations in a cloud-native context.
