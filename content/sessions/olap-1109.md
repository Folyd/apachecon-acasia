Apache Druid is a well-known OLAP analysis engine that has been in development since its initial release of version 0.1 at the end of 2012. After a decade of development, it has finally reached its latest major release of version 26.x, which has elevated both its architecture design and performance to unprecedented levels. In this presentation, I will take you on a deep dive into the development history of Druid, as well as the powerful features that the latest version brings.
