With the introduction of JVMT technology, the javaagent-based instrumentation like Apache Skywalking-Java is becoming more and more popular among users. Although javaagent is non-intrusive to the user's code, the corresponding instrumentation code needs to be adapted accordingly when user's code changes. Apache Tomcat, as an active open-source project with a long history, has so many releases, and Apache Tomcat releases quite frequently, which brings a lot of challenges to the development of javaagent. This session builds a unified instrumentation for all versions of Apache Tomcat in javaagent, and ensures the completeness of the instrumentation by statically analysing the code of javaagent and Apache Tomcat.
