As the rapid development of smart homes, the industrial internet, and vehicle networking accelerates, the demand for message communication targeting IoT (Internet of Things) devices is experiencing unprecedented growth. Under such circumstances, efficient and reliable messaging standards have become pivotal. The MQTT protocol, widely recognized in the new generation of IoT scenarios, is gradually becoming the industry standard. The MQTT 5.0 protocol, with its superior design, has emerged as a new industry standard in IoT scenarios.

In this session, we will introduce the serverless core design implemented on the foundation of RocketMQ for the MQTT 5.0 protocol. We will specifically demonstrate how to re-engineer the storage mechanism for open-source retain and will messages, ensure the stable and reliable delivery of messages, and implement core protocol designs such as ordered messages, shared subscriptions, and message TTL.

Faced with the challenge of peak and trough differences in device communication periods, we will also discuss how to apply the serverless architecture to the message queue, effectively reducing operational costs while taking advantage of the cloud-native environment features to provide fast response and flexible scaling communication capabilities for IoT devices.

Furthermore, we will explore the practical integration of MQTT in the cloud ecosystem and introduce a unified storage-based data ecosystem integration solution.
