RocketMQ, as a widely used distributed messaging middleware, relies on its ACL (Access Control List) mechanism to ensure system security. With the advancement of technology and the expansion of business scale, the original ACL 1.0 faces several security challenges, such as the misuse of IP whitelists, lack of fine-grained control, and access control between components. To address these issues, RocketMQ has introduced ACL 2.0, which incorporates mechanisms such as the separation of user authentication and permission verification, balancing security and performance, multiple matching modes for authorized resources, and flexible and extensible plugin architecture. It also integrates RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) mechanisms, providing a multi-dimensional permission control system with roles like super users and regular users, greatly enhancing the security of the messaging middleware and offering more precise access control. Furthermore, it lays a solid foundation for secure operations in large-scale distributed environments while ensuring performance and scalability.
