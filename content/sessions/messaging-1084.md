From the model design of RocketMQ to its internal mechanics, this topic comprehensively analyzes the iterative evolution of the batch message features in RocketMQ. Through continuous and relentless iteration, the AutoBatch feature is implemented, enhancing usability while achieving performance that reaches advanced industry levels, thus meeting various business needs. This subject not only shares the principles of RocketMQ and the evolution of batch processing, but also includes performance optimization related to batch message, which I believe will provide some different perspectives for everyone.
