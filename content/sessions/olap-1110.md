The session by Meituan explores their use of Spark with a vectorized engine in their production environment. It covers the identification of current bottlenecks, the rationale behind choosing Gluten as a Spark plugin, the necessity for a vectorized engine, ongoing research in this area, and the tangible cost savings and performance improvements realized in their real-world operations. The presentation offers detailed insights into Meituan's challenges, decision-making process, and the transformative impact of adopting a vectorized engine in their large-scale data processing pipeline. The session will cover below information:
- Spark Use Case at Meituan
- Meituan's Challenge in implementing vectorization
- Why choosing Gluten + Velox as the optimal solution
- Cost & Performance Results in a real case
- Future Vectorization Plan
