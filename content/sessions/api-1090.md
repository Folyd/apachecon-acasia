In recent years, the comparison between monolithic architecture and microservice architecture has once again appeared in everyone's field of vision and has been widely discussed. There have even been cases of migration back to monolithic architecture from microservice architecture. So, is monolithic architecture superior, or is microservice architecture superior? There are no silver bullets in the software world, and the right choice is what suits you.
Apache Dubbo has many excellent features and capabilities in the domain of microservice architecture. How can it support both monolithic and microservice architectures, allowing a software system to switch between them? This gives credit to the multi-instance capabilities of the Apache Dubbo 3.x version.
