In the landscape of the Industrial Internet, time-series data has emerged as a pivotal source of value cutting across various sectors, stemming from devices, sensors, and other terminal points. The onset of the Industrial Internet era heralds a new era characterized by the coordinated interplay of devices, edges, and the cloud: Devices represent the terminal equipment for data collection; edges serve as the controllers at the edge responsible for data aggregation; while the cloud denotes the cloud servers utilized for data processing. This symbiotic relationship between end devices and the cloud forms a comprehensive closed-loop ecosystem within the Industrial Internet, encompassing both data upstream transmission from the end to the cloud and downstream transmission from the cloud back to the end.

In this context, the latest iteration of IoTDB stands out for its innovative inclusion of a stream processing engine, enabling support for functionalities such as data synchronization and real-time streaming computation. This advancement provides a holistic solution tailored for Industrial Internet edge-cloud applications. This presentation aims to delve into the fundamental principles, practical usage techniques, typical application scenarios, and recent advancements of the IoTDB stream processing engine.
