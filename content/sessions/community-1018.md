Join my talk to explore the comprehensive experience of a developer in the Apache StreamPark project. From initial coding attempts to deep community engagement, I will share the technical challenges faced, solutions implemented, and collaborations with other developers throughout this journey. This presentation is not only an analysis of StreamPark's functionalities but also an exploration of personal growth and the power of community. Hear me narrate how I found my place in this open-source project, witnessed the integration of technology and human insight through practical examples, and embraced the opportunities found amidst challenges.
