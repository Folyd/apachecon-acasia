The convergence of data lakes and data warehouses into a unified architecture, known as the Lakehouse paradigm, has gained significant traction in the data engineering community. Apache Iceberg has emerged as a cornerstone technology for implementing Lakehouse architectures, providing robust features for managing large-scale, transactional data lakes efficiently.
In this session, we will explore best practices for implementing a Lakehouse architecture using Apache Iceberg. Through real-world examples and practical insights, attendees will learn how to design, deploy, and optimize a Lakehouse solution that leverages the strengths of Iceberg for data management, reliability, and performance.
