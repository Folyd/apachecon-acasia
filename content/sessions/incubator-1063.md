Numerous graph systems, such as Neo4j, Nebula Graph, and Apache HugeGraph, have been developed in recent years. Each of these systems has its own graph data storage format, complicating the exchange of graph data between different systems. The need for a standard data file format for large-scale graph data storage and processing that can be used by diverse existing systems is evident, as it would reduce overhead when various systems work together. 
To fill this gap, we start the GraphAr project to providing a standard data file format for graph data storage and exchange. 
On March 25, 2024, GraphAr officially entered the Apache  Incubator. This sharing session will revolve around the origins and development journey of the GraphAr project, as well as its journey into the Apache Incubator. It will introduce the opportunities and challenges GraphAr during the incubation process, and as a new member of the incubator, it will cover our understanding and implementation of the Apache Way.
