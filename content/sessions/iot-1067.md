Apache IoTDB (Database for Internet of Things) is a high performance IoT-native distributed time series database system.  In this session, we first give a brief introduction of IoTDB. Then, we discuss its scalable partitioning algorithm and its innovative load balancing.  Following that, we present a unified framework for consensus algorithms that support various consensus algorithms, including a strong consistency consensus algorithm (Raft) implemented by Apache Ratis (a high performance Raft library) and a weak consistency consensus algorithm based on asynchronous replication ideas.  We also give a brief introduction of Ratis and discuss why IoTDB chose it among a long list of Raft implementations.  Lastly, we share some reflections on deploying and applying this framework in time series scenarios.
