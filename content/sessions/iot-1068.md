Apache StreamPipes is a self-service (Industrial) IoT toolbox to enable non-technical users to connect, analyze and explore IoT data streams With the addition of support for the Pulsar messaging system in Apache StreamPipes version 0.93.0, we gain the ability to combine the user-friendly interface of StreamPipes with the powerful streaming message processing and storage capabilities of Pulsar. This makes it easier to build more intricate and performance-demanding iot stream processing applications.

In this talk, we'll discuss how we can efficiently construct and operate iot stream services using StreamPipes and Pulsar. We'll focus on leveraging StreamPipes to build streaming computing applications based on Pulsar, utilizing Pulsar's existing features such as various subscription models, precise message acknowledgment mechanisms, data schema, message read/write optimization, to enrich the streaming computing capabilities of StreamPipes. We'll also explore best practices for developing iot streaming services using StreamPipes and Pulsar.
