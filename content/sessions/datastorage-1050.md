ResilientDB is a distributed blockchain framework that is open-source, lightweight, modular, and highly performant.

ResilientDB is a High Throughput Yielding Permissioned Blockchain Fabric founded by ExpoLab at UC Davis in 2018. ResilientDB advocates a system-centric design by adopting a multi-threaded architecture that encompasses deep pipelines. Further, ResilientDB modulizes each component (network, consensus protocols, and applications) enabling each level of developers to focus on their majors.
