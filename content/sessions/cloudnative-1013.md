n this session, I will be introducing BanyanDB's latest column-based storage engine. This advanced technology is designed to be more memory-efficient, requiring less storage and reducing the overhead associated with managing observability data.

Introducing this new engine is a significant breakthrough in our ability to handle large volumes of data effectively and efficiently. We will discuss its design principles, benefits, and the impact it can have on current systems. Furthermore, we will explore its potential applications and the future direction of this technology within the landscape of cloud-native systems.
