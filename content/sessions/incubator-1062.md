Join me as I share Answer's journey—from the transformative insights gained by participating in open source, through the story-rich donation process to Apache, to the challenging yet rewarding path to our first release. Discover how open source reshaped my understanding, the collaborative efforts behind Answer's integration into the Apache Software Foundation, and the persistence needed to navigate the complexities of launching our initial version. This session is a concise exploration of lessons learned and the unyielding spirit of the open-source community.
