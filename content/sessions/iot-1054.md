Apache IoTDB is a time-series database designed specifically for industrial IoT scenarios, supporting flexible standalone or distributed deployments at the edge, on-premises, and in the cloud. In industrial IoT environments, data synchronization between edge and cloud is a common application. This presentation will introduce the application of Apache IoTDB in edge-to-cloud data synchronization, divided into the following five parts:

1. Exploring the need for edge-to-cloud data synchronization through scenarios in renewable energy and heavy manufacturing industries.
2. Analyzing the advantages and pain points of existing edge-to-cloud data synchronization solutions.
3. Tracing the evolution of IoTDB's edge-to-cloud data synchronization solution.
4. Introducing the all-new one-stop solution for edge-to-cloud data synchronization: IoTDB Pipe.
5. Showcasing the envisioned data ecosystem based on IoTDB Pipe and demonstrating its unlimited possibilities.
