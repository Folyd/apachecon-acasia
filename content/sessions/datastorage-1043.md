title: "High Performance IoT Data Replication Over Raft"
date: "2024-07-26 16:45:00" 
track: "datastorage"
presenters: "Ziyang Song"
stype: "Chinese Session"

Firstly, this session will introduce Apache IoTDB, IoT native distributed database and its high-availability design considerations. Then the session talks about the rationale behind choosing the Raft consensus algorithm and Apache Ratis library. After that, the session will give an overview of how Apache IoTDB uses Apache Ratis, its considerations and improvements. Finally, the session will talk about IoT-specific optimizations on Raft, namely, Non-Blocking Raft and community's plans on implementing ande deploying NB-Raft on IoTDB.
