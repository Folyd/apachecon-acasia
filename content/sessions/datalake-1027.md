The session explores the collaborative use of Kyuubi, a pure SQL gateway, and Gluten, a vectorized execution engine, to enhance the performance of SQL queries. Kyuubi simplifies large-scale data manipulation for end-users through Thrift JDBC/ODBC interface or RESTful api, reducing barriers to lakehouse usage. Its multi-tenant architecture ensures resource isolation/sharing and data security on the server side. The session focuses on Netease's implementation of Kyuubi with Gluten and Velox as the backend engine, aiming to address performance bottlenecks and sharing real-case results. Gluten supports various native backends, with current emphasis on Velox and ClickHouse, and potential integration with projects like Apache Data Fusion in the future.
