Apache NuttX is a real-time operating system (RTOS) that is characterized by its compliance with standards and small footprint. It can be extended in 8- to 64-bit microcontroller environments and mainly follows Posix and ANSI standards. The overall design, code organization, and compilation process of Apache NuttX are very similar to Linux, which will greatly reduce the migration cost for Android/Linux developers. This presentation will introduce the design principles and main subsystems of Apache NuttX, including: 
1. Compatibility with POSIX standards to improve development efficiency and code reusability, and reduce the learning curve;
2. High completeness to reduce development costs, providing functions such as file systems, network protocol stacks, graphics libraries, driver frameworks, and shells; 
3. Modular design that can be trimmed and customized based on Kconfig configuration, suitable for different product forms.

Joined Xiaomi in 2017 and was mainly responsible for the development of the Vela kernel. In 2018, he submitted his first patch to the NuttX community and continued to submit patches to the community over the next few years, completing the transition from a regular contributor to a Committer and then to a PMC member. Currently, he has provided more than 400 patches, covering modules such as IPC, Scheduler, SMP, Arch, MM, etc., and his contributions can be found throughout the Apache NuttX kernel.
