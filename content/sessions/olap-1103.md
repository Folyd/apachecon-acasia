High cardinality is a significant challenge for time series databases (TSDBs). This can occur when the metric is tracking a large number of entities, or when the metric itself has a high number of possible values.
Traditional time-series databases are often not optimized to handle large numbers of unique value combinations, leading to performance degradation and inefficiencies when dealing with high-cardinality metrics.
This topic will explore how Apache HoraeDB tackles this issue.
