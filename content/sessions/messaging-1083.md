Messaging systems have evolved alongside the concepts of cloud native and microservices, witnessing the vitality of highly dynamic and asynchronous systems such as serverless and event-driven architectures. Consequently, the architecture and models of message queues themselves have undergone significant changes. This talk presents how a data-intensive application introduces new solutions to support massive queues during its modernization journey. It will cover tiered storage capabilities and new index designs, granular traffic control for warm and hot data, as well as experiments with cloud-native storage and integrated hardware-software technologies. The discussion will delve into the analysis and trade-offs of technology choices, sharing how foundational infrastructure services like messaging systems leverage the benefits from both software and hardware advancements. These advancements meet the growing needs for data analytics in Stream Processing and Real-Time Analysis scenarios while balancing cost with machine efficiency. The session aims to show how message infrastructure can truly embrace cloud-native principles, extending message strategies into the realm of streams, and serving as the foundation for the future of Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), comprehensive serverless, and lightweight computing environments.
