English: LLM is increasingly being applied in work and life. Using dialogue to generate SQL with LLM will help improve the efficiency of data analysis.
No matter what LLM is used to generate SQL, there are always some problems with evaluating the generated SQL:
- How to achieve equivalence judgment for different SQL dialects?
- How to achieve equivalence judgment for functions with the same semantics but different names?
- How to achieve equivalence judgment for SQL with different intermediate logic and the same final result?
Using Apache Calcite for "standardization" rewriting can effectively solve the above problems.
