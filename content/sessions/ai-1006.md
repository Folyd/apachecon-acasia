Data driven by LLMs can make applications more efficient, accurate and personalized, and AI has been widely used in a variety of scenarios, such as natural language processing, recommendation systems and data analysis, and has achieved remarkable results. Big models can better optimize data, and deeply optimized data can better train big models, LLMs and data complement each other.

In this talk, we will introduce how our open source Gravitino builds a unified metadata lake to manage all the metadata of data teams and AI teams with Single Source Of Truth, which not only fills the gap of metadata management of AI models, but also provides clients in Java, Python, and NodeJS, which allows data teams, AI teams, and business teams from different departments to use Gravitino to manage their metadata in a single source of truth. Gravitino not only fills the gap of AI model metadata management, but also provides Java, Python, and NodeJS clients, allowing data teams, AI teams, and business teams from different departments to seamlessly complete the whole process of data ETL, data cleansing, feature engineering, model training, model release, and APP and model integration, accelerating the integration of data and AI.

Gravitino also provides unified IAM privilege management and unified read/write of heterogeneous (structured/unstructured) data from multiple data sources to support multi-cloud, so that AI teams can make full use of the GPU, storage, cloud services and other infrastructure resources in both public and private data centers, and reduce the cost and cycle of model training.
He will also share how Xiaomi, Vipshop, and other Internet companies use Gravitino to solve problems and challenges in AI model training.
