The development of microservices has greatly solved the issue of organizational specialization. However, it has also introduced some challenges:

1. Business developers need to be aware of complex infrastructure, leading to slow start-ups and low development efficiency.
2. There is no standard for microservices decomposition. Insufficient decomposition may lead to collaboration blockers among team members, while over-decomposition may lead to resource usage and long-term maintenance cost issues.
3. How to establish a rational standard for microservice decomposition to fundamentally avoid issues of under- or over-decomposition?

After researching these pain points, the Middleware Team at Ant Group has designed an upgrade to the traditional microservice decomposition model that addresses infrastructure abstraction and refines development and operation granularity. Unlike traditional microservices that only undergo horizontal decomposition, this upgraded model includes both vertical and horizontal divisions. It divides vertically into bases and modules, so modules do not consume extra machine capacity (saving resources), and module developers only focus on their business logic (low cognitive load). Horizontally, it decomposes into multiple modules, allowing developers to iterate independently without interference (high collaboration efficiency).

This new architectural model has been adopted by all BGs within Ant Group, integrating 700k core applications. With this new model, build sizes have been reduced from gigabytes to megabytes, business startup times have decreased to seconds, and iteration efficiency has been greatly improved, earning recognition and praise from business teams.

Speech Outline:

1. Background of microservices and application development at Ant Group.
2. Solutions and outcomes of the Koupleless development framework.
3. Introduction to the Koupleless operation scheduling platform.
4. The full capabilities required by this model.
5. The advantages and disadvantages of this model, and how to balance them.
6. Practical experience and case study outcomes.
7. Summary and future outlook.

What you'll gain:

1. Insights into Ant Group's cutting-edge technology and achievements in microservices and application development.
2. New perspectives on rational microservice decomposition, addressing issues from over-decomposition or lack thereof, while also avoiding the additional overhead of microservices. You can also adopt Koupleless to help your enterprise significantly cut costs and boost efficiency.
3. Understanding how the new model balances pros and cons, finding the optimal balance between isolation and sharing to solve current issues.
4. Awareness of the current status and challenges of this new model within the industry, as well as future prospects.
