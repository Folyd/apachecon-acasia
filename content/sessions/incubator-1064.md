It tells the story of a newbie born in 2003 who participated in open source for the first time. He gradually participated in the apache straempark community, led several major features, and was nominated as a committer.
And he joined the new company with his open source contributions and was responsible for the company's internal StreamPark-related development. In this process, I have grown a lot from the community to the code. I will share my journey along the way, my understanding of open source and community, and my feelings about the streampark community.
Finally, share the current work being done by the StreamPark community and the future plans of the community.
