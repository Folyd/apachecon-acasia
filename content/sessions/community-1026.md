Building community in the company? I know it sounds hard, but it's also challenging and fun. In this talk, I'll share my experience of introducing the open-source culture to my company, and the practices of building an inner source or open-source-like community in the company. At the same time, I'm also building a real open-source community outside the company (https://codekitchen.community). I'll share the differences and lessons learned from building these two communities, and how to find the connections to empower each other.
