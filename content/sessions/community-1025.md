In the era of AI 2.0, the emergence of open-source large language models like LlaMa and Mistral are transforming the community and experiences of AI developers, offering unprecedented opportunities and challenges for Business-to-Developer (B2D) operations. As a B2D operator, you might be considering the following questions:

- Are you searching for targeted content marketing strategies that resonate with AI developers, capture their attention, and unleash their potential?

- Have you considered how AI large language model developers differ from traditional developers? What kind of decision-making process do they undertake when choosing products? What are the benefits, pain points, and critical factors at each stage of the developer journey?

- Have you observed that despite developers' general indifference to marketing tactics, they are influenced by certain strategies on a subconscious level? What is the secret to the success of these methods?

- Are you interested in learning how leading AI large language model companies attract and retain users through technical content and marketing practices, foster and strengthen trust through community events and support services, and grow their ecosystem with product updates and announcements?

In my presentation, drawing on my experience in content creation and community management at 01.AI, I will analyze real-world challenges, structure the thought process, investigate approaches to problem-solving, and offer actionable solutions. My goal is to assist you in producing high-quality content, enhancing your marketing strategies, and broadening your collaborative network, ultimately contributing to a thriving open-source AI developer community.
