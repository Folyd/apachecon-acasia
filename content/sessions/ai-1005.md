As the integration of data and AI grows tighter, unified management of both becomes an internal challenge for enterprises. Databricks has introduced a commercial product that bridges big data and AI through the Unity Catalog. However, since it is proprietary, it is difficult for enterprises to implement this solution internally.

In the past few years, Xiaomi has unified the metadata system for table data management, which has brought significant benefits. This year, we have extended the metadata management to the AI data domain. With Gravitino, we can manage both non-tabular and tabular data under a unified system, achieving unified metadata for data+AI.

Outline:
1) Xiaomi's Business Characteristics and Challenges
   - Managing tabular data includes not only Hive and Iceberg but also OLTP tables such as MySQL and Oracle. Unified management of these data types enhances internal efficiency.
2) Integrated Needs for Data + AI
   - With the rising popularity of large models, the integration of data and AI is increasingly mentioned. Unified metadata is essential for integrating data+AI. We will share the elements Xiaomi has implemented for data+AI integration.
3) Unified Metadata Based on Gravitino
   - How Xiaomi achieves unified metadata management for data+AI based on Gravitino.
4) Online Development Platform Based on Unified Metadata
   - Using Gravitinoâ€™s powerful engine plugins and PythonClient, how a unified development platform is implemented. We will share the conveniences developers can enjoy.
5) Future Plans for Gravitino
   - We will share the future planning of the Gravitino community.
