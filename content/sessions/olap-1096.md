In early 2022, Intel and Kyligence unveiled Gluten, an open-source project succeeding the Gazelle project. Gazelle, an Apache Arrow-based native SQL engine by Intel, aimed to alleviate Spark SQL processing. Gluten supersedes Gazelle, amalgamating various native engines such as Velox and ClickHouse, providing performance enhancements for Apache Spark users. By connecting Spark with vectorized SQL engines, Gluten tackles performance hurdles and harnesses Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) technology. The project offers components like the Gluten Plugin, Plan Conversion, Fallback Processing, Memory Management, Columnar Shuffle, Shim Layer, and Metrics, seamlessly integrating with Spark and native libraries. Intel collaborates with Meta and the Velox community, achieving up to an 8x speedup with Velox backend integration. By 2024, Gluten was contributed to Apache, becoming Apache Gluten (incubating). Apache Gluten, an open-source project with a vibrant developer community, plans to support transaction benchmarks and expand compatibility with hardware accelerators like GPUs and FPGAs.
