In the olden days it there was little choice about where to render web pages - it all happened on the server. Now there are many choices - server-side, client-side, edge, and various mixtures thereof. Making the wrong choice can be hard to revert and will have negative impacts throughout the lifecycle of a web application.

This talk will present the major approaches for rendering, outline their benefits and trade-offs from a user experience, developer experience, and operational point of view.  The code samples will be built on top of Apache Sling, a Java-based web application framework, but previous knowledge of Sling is not required. We will also explore Apache Traffic Server as an edge server enabling offloading the rendering.

After this talk attendees will gain a better practical understanding of various rendering approaches for web applications and will have a framework for selecting the appropriate rendering architecture for their applications.
