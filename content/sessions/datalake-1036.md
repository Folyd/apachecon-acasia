In this presentation, I will delve into the core implementation details of the Apache Paimon Data Lake project.

1.I will introduce the logic behind CDC Ingestion, a crucial data synchronization mechanism that allows for the real-time capture and integration of data changes. This ensures that the information within the data lake is always up-to-date.
2.I will discuss in detail the read and write processes of Paimon tables, along with the design philosophy. This part will include an understanding of the Paimon architecture, especially how to effectively manage and access data stored in the data lake. We will explore how to optimize the organization and retrieval of data through the core concepts of 'Bucket' and 'Tag', thereby improving the efficiency of data processing.
3.I will explain the implementation logic of Deduplication, Partial Update, and the Aggregation Merge Engine under the Primary Key Table.
Through this presentation, participants will gain a deep understanding of the Apache Paimon Data Lake project.
