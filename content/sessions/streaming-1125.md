HStream is a modern distributed streaming data platform compatible with the Kafka protocol. It is open-sourced at https://github.com/hstreamdb/hstream. With its cloud-native architectural design and storage engine optimized for large-scale streaming data, HStream successfully eliminates many of Apache Kafka's pain points, allowing users to efficiently complete one-stop ingestion, storage, processing, and distribution of all real-time messages, events, and other data streams on a single platform.

In this session, we will introduce the technical evolution of streaming data platform, HStream's technical architecture and streaming storage engine design, including how HStream solves Kafka's pain points in fast elastic scaling, replica migration, load skewing, high data reliability, etc.
