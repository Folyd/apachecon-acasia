In this demonstration, we will explore the application of statistics based on parquet files in the SparkSQL optimizer, focusing on the implementation of cost-based optimizations using these statistics.

We will discuss the challenges in the Query optimization and how to collect statistics in a low cost way.

In addition, we will share some cost-based optimization rules, including exchange elimination, bloom filter pushdown, parallelism estimation, etc., and show how to use statistical information to avoid Bad cases in these optimization rules.

We will also share the results verified on ultra-large-scale data to demonstrate the effectiveness of these optimizations.
